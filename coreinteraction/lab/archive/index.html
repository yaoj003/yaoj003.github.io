                <p>
                This course serves as a complement to Core Studio Interaction. 
              	The assignments are build to work in tandem with the projects 
              	students are developing in the studio class. The lab is designed 
              	around a series of small work-shops that teach beginning and 
              	intermediate interaction design through a hands on engagement 
              	with HTML and CSS.

                I was inspired to do a pie chart to represent my sections
                by this website. I loved the fun and quirky colors, which 
                made the website bright and approachable. I realized that
                while the colors and the design were being used as only decoration here, I could
                used to them define each section.

                I researched the Swiss graphic designer Walter Herdeg, specifically his
                work on data visualization in his book Graphis Diagrams. Herdeg is known for his 
                quintessential Swiss design and has been called the “epitome of a post-war Modernist.” 
                One of his greatest contributions was  
                the creation and publication of Graphis, a bi-monthly design magazine.

              <p>
                A designer and programmer named Rune Madsen was inspired by Herdeg’s work and
                created an interactive website using Processing that displays a diagram of words from
                nine famous speeches. While this is beyond what I am trying to make, it was really 
                interesting to see a diagram as virtual and interactive thing.

                  WEEK 1
                  <br>
                  For the first week of this project, I brainstormed ideas about how to represent a syllabus. 
                  I wanted my webpage to stay true to the form of an archive and to be easy to navigate.
                  Since our syllabus is structured into sections, I wanted each section to be separate.
                  I explored forms of data visualization, icons, and hanging mobiles for the structure of 
                  this webpage.

                <p>WEEK 2
                  <br>
                  I decided to draw inspiration for my webpage from interactive graphs. 
                  This week, I sketched out the webpage using a pie chart to represent
                  the size of each section based on the length of the content and its
                  importance in our class curriculum.

                  WEEK 3
                  <br> After this week's class, I revised my idea of the pie 
                  chart to be more minimalistic and easier to make. Here, I wanted to use 
                  the vertical bars to represent the "size" of each section.
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  <img src="assets/img/s31.png" height="150px" weight="116px"></img>
                  <img src="assets/img/s32.png" height="150px" weight="116px"></img>
                  <img src="assets/img/s33.png" height="150px" weight="116px"></img>
                  <img src="assets/img/s34.png" height="150px" weight="116px"></img>
                  <br><br>
                  <img src="assets/img/s35.png" height="150px" weight="116px"></img>
                  <img src="assets/img/s36.png" height="150px" weight="116px"></img>
                  <img src="assets/img/s37.png" height="150px" weight="116px"></img>
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  In the end, I made the section bars horizontal and different lengths to 
                  represent the different "sizes." This was a lot easier than making
                  the bars vertical and allowed me to use the scroll function inside the
                  section contents. I used jQuery to make the accordion interface, which
                  Ryan suggested I research last week.
