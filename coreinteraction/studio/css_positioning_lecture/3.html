BLOCK VS INLINE-BLOCK VS INLINE VS NONE


We can change the default behavior with the first positioning property we'll learn: the display property. We'll learn about four possible values.

BLOCK: This makes the element a block box. It won't let anything sit next to it on the page! It takes up the full width. Try applying this to all the divs.

INLINE-BLOCK: This makes the element a block box, but will allow other elements to sit next to it on the same line. Try applying this to all the divs.

INLINE: This makes the element sit on the same line as another element, but without formatting it like a block. It only takes up as much width as it needs (not the whole line). Try applying this to all the divs.

none: This makes the element and its content disappear from the page entirely! Try applying this to all the divs.
