FLOATS

So we know how our individual elements are constructed. But how do we determine where they go on the page?

One way is with floats. You are telling everything on the page to act sorta like its in the sea and float next to everything else.

1) Make the div float to the right
2) Add <p> tags with some text inside and float it to the left

  <head>
    <link type="text/css" rel="stylesheet" href="styles/5_stylesheet.css"/>
    <title>Result</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <div></div>
  </body>
